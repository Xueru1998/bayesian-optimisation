Some have noted similarities between ""Parasite"" and the works of other South Korean directors, such as Bong Joon-ho, who is known for his socially conscious films that explore class struggles and the consequences of economic inequality.

Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote: ""Bong's film is a sharply observed study of two different worlds that collide in unexpected ways, revealing the deep-seated divisions between them."" He also praised the film's pacing and tone, calling it ""a thrilling ride that never loses its way.""

A.O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, noted that ""Parasite"" is ""a richly entertaining and thought-provoking film"" that ""uses humor and satire to explore some of the most pressing social issues of our time."" He praised the film's ability to balance its political message with a compelling narrative, calling it ""a rare work of art that manages to be both funny and frightening at the same time.""

Other critics have also highlighted the film's innovative use of cinematography and editing, which adds to the overall sense of unease and tension. The film's score, which combines traditional Korean music with modern electronic elements, has also been praised for its ability to enhance the viewing experience.

Overall, ""Parasite"" has received widespread critical acclaim for its bold and timely themes, as well as its technical and artistic accomplishments."
